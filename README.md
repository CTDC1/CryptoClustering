# CryptoClustering


This repository contains data analysis of cryptocurrencies and their percentage change over different periods. We created an original scaled data plot and a PCA scaled data plot to compare what impact fewer features have on the plots.

To analyze these data points, we first found the best value for ‘k’ with the original data and clustered the cryptocurrencies. Next, we optimized the clusters with principal component analysis. We then repeated the functions to produce the k-means with the PCA data and compared the two clusters to determine the effect of fewer features.
